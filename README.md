# Tinnova front end test

## Requirements

All the requirements are in the /Doc/requirements.pdf file.

## Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
- [MUI](https://material-ui.com/)

## Installation

You need to open the terminal and run the following command at the root of the project:

    npm install 
    or
    yarn install

  You'll start at the main page, where you can see the list of projects, and start at the first one.
  After that, you can go to the first question page, solve it (or verify it) and go to the next one.
